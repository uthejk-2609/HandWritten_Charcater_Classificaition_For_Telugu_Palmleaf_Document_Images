# HandWritten_Charcater_Classificaition_For_Telugu_Palmleaf_Document_Images

Handwritten recognition field is in an active state due to ease of access through the digitization world. A challenging task in handwritten recognition is various strokes, styles, and contracts of handwriting. Deep Learning is the optimistic way to handle the haziness of the data. The overall work for handwritten character recognition is categorized into three parts. The first part is to characterize the palm leaf image and then character extraction, which is the main part and finally, the recognition of characters. This research paper comprises two main sections: palm leaf classification and character classification. Both classifications involve the utilization of multiple classifiers, and it was observed that the Custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) yielded the most favorable results for both the classifications. The model developed for palm leaf classification achieved impressive training accuracy of 98.9%, and a commendable test accuracy of 97.5%. In contrast, the character classification model displayed solid performance during training, achieving an average accuracy of about 93%. In testing, it maintained a commendable accuracy rate of around 93%, which was further supported by a validation accuracy of 90%.
